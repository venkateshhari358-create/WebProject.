WebProject Description

Abstract:

This project presents a **solar-powered, Raspberry Pi–based GPRS water quality monitoring system** for real-time and eco-friendly water analysis. Key parameters such as **pH, temperature, turbidity, and TDS** are continuously monitored using sensors interfaced with the Raspberry Pi. The system transmits data wirelessly to a remote server via **GPRS**, enabling real-time monitoring from any location. Powered by solar energy, it is suitable for remote and unreliable power areas. The system supports early detection of water contamination and provides a **low-cost, scalable, and energy-efficient IoT solution** for sustainable water management and pollution control.
